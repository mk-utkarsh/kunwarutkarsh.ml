The process of creating a website from scratch can be an exhausting process and requires tonnes of knowledge about web development, especially HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Often, the time taken to develop a website may not be worthwhile. One of the most prominent solutions to this problem right now is Hugo- a very fast, flexible and free open source framework for building static websites.

### What are Static Sites?

A static site is a website that consists of web pages with fixed content that is pre-written and does not change dynamically. This means that the content of the website is created and stored in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are uploaded to a web server and served to users when they visit the site.

Hence, static websites do not require knowledge of database management and are comparatively easier to develop as compared to dynamic sites. Static sites are mostly used for webpages with low content and less frequent updates. This makes such type of sites the most used for personal blogs, online portfolios, etc.
